# The Green Net National Product: *Subproject regarding pollution of the water environment*

Eutrophication is the process of nutrient over-enrichment of water bodies due to pollution from agriculture and point sources. Such pollution can lead to high algae growth and thus oxygen depletion which reduces the ecological conditions of water bodies.

## Assessing the ecological status of water bodies

The ecological conditions in water bodies can be quantified directly in form of the concentration of chlorophyll *a* (for lakes and coastal waters) found in algae or indirectly using biological indicators that are responsive to eutrophication.

For **streams**, the most long-lasting biological indicator for water quality in Danish streams is the DVFI index *(Dansk Vandløbsfaunaindeks)* which measures the occurrence and composition of benthic macroinvertebrates (small bottom-living animals without backbone) which is one of many modified versions of the Trent Biotic Index (TBI) that was developed in 1964 for the River Trent watershed in England ([Andersen et al, 1984 - *English*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0043135484900629)). In 1998 the Danish index was improved as observations before that are less consistent ([Danish Environmental Protection Agency, 1998 - *Danish*](https://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/Publikationer/1998/87-7810-995-7/pdf/87-7810-995-7.PDF)).

### Demarcation of water bodies

This project follows the demarcation of water bodies given by the current water body plan (VP2) which is the Danish Government's implementation of phase two of the European Union's [Water Framework Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/).

## Ecological status of water bodies by year

The current water body plan (VP2) covers 17933 km of streams, of which streams representing 16444 km (91%) have been assessed at least once. On average streams representing 4413 km (24%) are assessed each year.

The map book below shows the ecological status of streams for each year from 1992-2019. Initially, the DVFI index was mostly used in the two [counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Denmark) Viborg and Ringkjøbing (in mid-western Jutland).

If your browser does not allow you to navigate the map book, you can [download it here](https://github.com/thornoe/GNNP/raw/master/gis/streams.pdf) instead.
