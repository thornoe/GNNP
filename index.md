# The Green Net National Product: *Subproject regarding pollution of the water environment*

Eutrophication is the process of nutrient over-enrichment of water bodies due to pollution from agriculture and point sources. This can lead to high algae growth and oxygen depletion which reduces the ecological water quality.




### Demarcation of water bodies

This project follows the demarcation of water bodies given by the current water body plan (VP2) which is the Danish Government's implementation of phase two of the European Union's [Water Framework Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/).


### Assessing the ecological status of streams

The most long-lasting biological indicator for water quality is the Danish index for benthic invertebrates in streams (DVFI) which divides
